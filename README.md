Identify the label of a fashion product image using convolutional neural networks

1. Image Classification using CNN
create a basic CNN model that can identify if an image is related to the following 13 subcategories: Topwear, Bottomwear, Bags, Watches, Jewellery, Eyewear, Wallets, Shoes, Sandal, Makeup,
Fragrance, Others. More specially, you are given a dataset containing 44,441 fashion product images.

• A report of the performance of your CNN model on both train and test
datasets in terms of accuracy.
• Describe the parameters of your model and the structure of your model
(you can use model.summary() if you are using keras).
• Write steps for us to replicate your experiments.

2. Improved Image Classification
Improve the base CNN model proposed in part 1. I'm consider the following ways to improve your baseline:
• Tuning parameters (e.g., number of filters, number of units for the dense
layer, add layers, activation function) on a dev set (part of your training
data)
• Apply transfer learning using a popular pre-trained image classification
model, e.g., VGG-19, Inception V3, and ResNet50 (https://keras.io/
api/applications/)
• Combine image and text (product description) for image classification
• Generating more image data for training (e.g., https://keras.io/api/
preprocessing/image/#imagedatagenerator-class).
